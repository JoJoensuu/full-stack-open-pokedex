In a scenario where a team of six developers is gearing up to release a Python-based application, streamlining their workflow through a Continuous Integration (CI) setup becomes quintessential. This would involve integrating tools that cater to linting, testing, and building processes, each fostering optimal code quality and operational efficiency.

Linting: In the Python landscape, Pylint is a popular choice. It scrutinizes the code against a vast collection of coding standards and heuristics. It not only detects errors but also enforces a coding standard and looks for code smells, thus ensuring code consistency across the team.

Testing: pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that assists in simple unit tests as well as complex functional testing. Its ease of use and ability to handle sophisticated testing needs make it a go-to for Python developers.

Building: Python utilizes setuptools to help in building the package, which can bundle together all dependencies and source code into a distributable format, easing the deployment process.

Deciding between a self-hosted and a cloud-based environment involves analyzing the project's scale, budget, and security requisites. A cloud-based setup might be favorable for its scalability and lower upfront costs, offering a collaborative platform that can be accessed from anywhere. However, a self-hosted setup grants more control over the environment, potentially enhancing security and customization possibilities. The choice largely depends on the specific needs and preferences of the project, requiring a comprehensive analysis of the potential scalability, security requirements, and financial allowances.
